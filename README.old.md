# JSX Fragments and Events

## Objective
Explore the use of React Fragments and event handling in JSX.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Locate the `App.js` file in the `src` folder.

## Tasks
1. Use a React Fragment to group an `<h1>` tag and a `<p>` tag. The `<h1>` should say "Welcome to React" and the `<p>` should contain a brief introduction about yourself.
2. Add a button with the text "Click me". Use an `onClick` event on the button to display an alert with a message of your choice.

## Advanced Task
Create a small form with an input field and a submit button. When the form is submitted, log the input value to the console. Make sure to use a React Fragment to wrap your form elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

## Submission
Commit and push your changes to this repository. Ensure your final `App.js` file demonstrates your understanding of React Fragments and handling events in JSX.
